# test-plugin

This plugin is only a **very crude, very alpha** and transitory plugin.  
It is for my own testing purposes only and in no way intended to be used in any way by others.  
###There is a better than good chance that installing it will break your Discourse.  


If and when the code proves to be safe to use, it will be moved into a proper plugin. 

## Installation

I **strongly"" advise you to _not_ install this plugin.

## Support 

I'm still learning so you are most likely a better coder than I am, but I frequently visit these forums and either I or others should be able to help.
